## Inspiration
A few nights ago, my friends and I were thinking of binge-watching an entire season and had an exam the next morning. We didn't know how long it would take. Luckily, one of our friends had an idea for building a website which tells the duration of watching a season. We came up with the idea for binge.time. âœ¨ 
## What it does
"It tells the amount of time required to binge watch an entire season or a certain part of the season according to your preferences
## How we built it
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- TVmaze API
- Styled components
- GoDaddy (for the domain)
- GitHub (for hosting the source code)

## Challenges we ran into
"The techstack which we picked was pretty new to the fellow developers, but they still managed to work out ðŸ¥³ !"
In just nearly 40 hours, we have met so many challenges and overcome most of those. That is what brings us many exciting moments, new knowledge and precious experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Work more efficiently and handle different parts of the project. Keeping the deadline in mind and forming a proper pathway to finish the project on time
## What we learned
We have learnt about a new library called [styled components], which allows to write CSS in JS ðŸ¤© .
The fellow developers have also learnt basics of React and how to work with React projects ðŸ¥³ 
## What's next for  Binge.time
- Creating a custom API for binge.time which suits for its job
- Adding a feature which allows to translate the website âœ¨
-Building a mobile app for it
